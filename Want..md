I know what [this post](https://www.tumblr.com/divorce-enjoyer/785313807215050752/i-didnt-know-you-were-allowed-to-do-things-for-the) was originally about. But [the death of the author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author?wprov=sfla1) has struck, and I regret to inform @divorce-enjoyer: you are the deceased.

This post is about everything that was, is, or will be a result of conscious action.

Everything we do, every choice that we make, ***all that we have created on this Earth***— from minute choices like not pissing our pants, to monumental achievements like going to the moon, to the murderous horrors of the Holocaust, the Great Leap Forward, the simultaneous colonization and genocide of the Americas, chattel slavery, the mistreatment of 100 billion caged animals, and every other atrocity committed by our kind, to what may kill us — anthropogenic omnicide, the death of humanity if we cause it — if we are our own undoing.

# Aren't all our actions results of our Wants?

You'll immediately say — but what about, like, paying my taxes or something? or eating? or using the bathroom?

But these "exceptions" are ones of necessity: things that we do because we *must*, consciously or unconsciously. Because if we consciously, willingly, perform an action, then why would we do it if we don't *want* to or *have* to do it? It is against the human spirit to do things we do not want to do. So the only things that we consciously do that are things that we "do not want to do": these necessary actions.

But, in a way, these necessary actions are still actions we want to do. Because think about it — if we didn't do those things, bad things would happen to us. if we don't pay our taxes, we are jailed. if we don't eat, we starve. and if we don't use the bathroom, we piss our pants. Actions are choices, and given the choice between paying our taxes and not paying our taxes, between eating and not eating, between using the bathroom and not using the bathroom, almost all of us would choose the former, in all of these cases. and we choose the former because we want to choose the former.

**because we WANT to choose the former**.

because we want to pay our taxes, rather than not pay our taxes. because we want to eat, rather than not eat. because we want to use the bathroom, not piss our pants.

And thus, **all** our conscious actions are the result of our **wants**. That's ***all*** our actions, both our rights and our wrongs.

# Our Wrongs.

Our wrongs are a result of our wants. Our wrongs are actions that we have performed, consciously, willingly, wantingly, to ourselves and to the animal kingdom that we are a part of. 

And much of what is wrong with the world is, too, a product of these wants.

**Rape.**

**Murder.**

**Climate change.**

**Poverty.**

**Capitalism.**

**Tuberculosis.** (I'll get to this.)

And worst of all, **fish farming.** (Yes, I'm serious.)

These are **all** products of the all-encompassing Apollyon that is human desire.

Rape exists because the rapist prioritizes their want over the raped. 

Murder exists because the murderer prioritizes their want over the murdered.

Climate change exists because the fossil fuel industry, those countries that produce the world's oil, America, OPEC, China – which uses half of the world's coal, the military industrial complex funded by these companies to drive oil prices up through brutal, genocidal war. These entities have no regard for the future of humanity. No regard for their progeny – and by them, I mean the executives and leaders who doom us, with no regard for the billions who will be affected by their greed. 

Their greed. 

Greed.

Greed is the selfish desire, or want, for something, over the wants of others, and the very cause of poverty. And poverty, and the structure that perpetuates it, capitalism, exist because those in power: the rich, the oligarchic bourgeoisie at the top of society, at the top of the world, prioritize their wants over that of the proletariat. Because they only care about their own lives, their own wellbeing, their own wealth. They don't care about the poor. And they don't care about
# tuberculosis.
tuberculosis exists, both because of poverty, and because no one with the power, with the money, has provided care for those who do not have it, as they prioritize their wants over the wants, the ***needs***, of people in extreme poverty. those who cannot afford even a $7.97 tuberculosis test. because the company providing the tests refuses to sell it at cost. because, despite public pressure, the company providing the test, Danaher, refuses to lower the price to what it costs to create. to lower it to 5 dollars. to lower it by $2.97.

I'll say it again:

**two dollars and ninety-seven cents.**

Danaher prioritizes these two dollars and ninety-seven cents over human lives.

Over the 1.25 million people that die each year of tuberculosis, the leading cause of death by a single infectious agent, the world record holder in infectious slaughter, having snatched its blood-stained crown back from COVID two years ago.

All because Danaher is a for-profit company. 

Because Danaher's primary objective, singular objective, legally mandated objective, fiduciary ***duty***, is to act in the best interests — ***wants*** — of its shareholders, and only its shareholders.

***only its shareholders.***

 because the deceased do not matter to a for-profit company. to *any* for profit company. because those who die of tuberculosis are precisely those who do not own shares of Danaher. those who are unable to buy shares of Danaher, the company, the evil entity, the mass murderer deciding their very fate. because they live in extreme poverty. poverty that we, too, have created.

and the deceased are doubly dispensable, detached from the bringer of death that is Danaher, because they are dead. 

and the dead cannot own shares. because they are dead. 

dead because of our mistakes. because of our wrongdoings. because of our wants. 

What could be worse than this?

I'll tell you what.

# Fish farming.

Hear me out— I'm not joking.

Factory farming, and its worst organ, fish farming, exist because the meat and fish eaters of the world ([myself included](https://www.tumblr.com/fastfouriertransfem/789340937673441280/addendum-you-probably-see-me-as-a-hypocrite-here?source=share)) prioritize their wants over the wants of the [100 billion killed every year for our pleasure.](https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-animals-are-factory-farmed) because of our desire, our want, for efficiency. just that *tiny extra bit* of efficiency. To save a buck, we cage — enslave — animals, giving them zero access to the outside world.

Farmed fish, fish that we enslave for our consumption, number [73 to 180 billion,](https://thehumaneleague.org.uk/article/fish-farming) between 9 and 22 times our human population of eight billion. The number of fish *currently* alive is around the number of humans which have *ever* been alive (around 100 billion.)

And ***this* is our greatest wrong.**

To show how truly awful this wrong is, I'll compare it to our second greatest wrong: the 0.97 to 2.74 ***trillion*** wild fish killed each year. The lower end of that estimate, 0.97 trillion, is 161666⅔ times the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust. And this is every year.

A human death pales in comparison, in suffering, to the deaths of 161666⅔ fish. Of course, a human death is awful. But fish feel pain. The same pain that we feel. And the pain that each fish will feel is the greatest pain it will feel in its life; its final cruel experience. 

Think about the worst pain you have felt in your life, and imagine living that 161666⅔ times. You'd probably rather just die in a gas chamber. If you wouldn't, many would.

And this is only the second greatest, because 2.74 trillion divided by 73 billion is around 37.53.

37.53 fish deaths pale in comparison to a year living in a fish farm.

>Imagine a swimming pool filled to the brim with fish, the water muddied with fish excrement. Now imagine ten of these in an indoor shed, or in the ocean, with nets for boundaries instead of solid walls. This is what factory fish farming looks like, where fish are held captive for their whole lives, manipulated from birth to death, all so that people can make a profit and satisfy the intense consumer demand for fish flesh. 

[The Humane League](https://thehumaneleague.org/article/factory-fish-farming)

I don't believe in Christianity, but it has great lore. And if it's real, *this* is the worst sin, worse than the original sin, the sin that damns all of humanity to hell. There are two ways of parsing the last sentence, and both are correct: both the original sin, in canon, and this non-canon, far worse, abhorrent, atrocious, worst-atrocity-of-all-time sin, damn all of humanity to hell.

But if there is no hell, we will go unpunished for this sin. 

We are monsters. We are evil. We are immoral. Most people are— as Peter Singer has detailed, in "[Famine, Affluence, and](https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil308/Singer2.pdf)
# Morality".
The natural state of humanity is egoism, specifically default egoism: by default, people tend to act in their own self interest. 

And this is *wrong*. 

*This is the cause of all of our problems: everything wrong with society, wrong with humanity, wrong with our species. Everything wrong that we have ever created. Every atrocity, every killing, every murder, every death.*

And hopefully now you see why this is the case. 

Because every action we consciously take is a result of our wants. And these actions include these innumerable wrongs.

It's all because of our wants.

The sum total of humanity's wants

has produced *extraordinary* suffering.

We are the producers of pain. We are the producers of suffering. How can we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers, the producers of the very suffering we seek to avoid?

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. You probably know this as a placeholder text. But it actually comes from De finibus bonorum et malorum:

> Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem, quia voluptas sit, aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos, qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt, neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum, quia dolor sit amet consectetur adipisci[ng] velit, sed quia non numquam [do] eius modi tempora inci[di]dunt, ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.

If you can't read Latin (me neither, lol) here's a translation ([H Rackam](https://archive.org/details/definibusbonoru02cicegoog)):

> No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter extremely painful consequences. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure [them] some great pleasure.

That is to say: We pursue pleasure. We avoid pain. And all of us do. 

Because we want to.

Each and every one of us wants to.

And this is wrong.

Our wants, the sum total of our wants, ***all*** of our wants are wrong.



Or *are they?*

**Or are they??**


So far, we've only focused on the wrongs, the abject horrors of life. 

But that's not all of life, is it?

No.

No, it isn't.

Because life also contains happiness.

Bliss.

Euphoria.

With dysphoria, there must also be euphoria; and with pain, there must also be pleasure.

So again.

We must consider all our wants.

We must consider all of humanity. No— all sentient beings in the universe.

Each of us must.

We must go beyond the basic desire to satisfy only our own wants. 

For there is a second desire we have evolved to want.

Love.

We must love each other. We must love all of humanity, all sentient beings, all of the beings in the universe.

Some call it Agape. I call it universal love.

And though I have mentioned it second, it is first in its strength.

Love trumps all.

Love trumps greed, trumps wrath, trumps sorrow, trumps hate (trumps Trump).

And it will be what saves us, what reforms us, what creates a better world. 

TODO: Discuss Singer's Famine, Affluence, and Morality.

Because love is what brings us together.

And we must band together.



All of us, we the sentient beings, of the universe, or even, multiverse, must band together. Humans, animals, aliens, deities, anyone and everyone. We all must band together.

And we must satisfy all our wants; all that do not conflict with others' wants. We must satisfy all the wants in the world, in the universe, in the multiverse. 

We must maximize wants; **preferences; *utility*.**

And we do this because we ***want*** to do this. We ***should*** want to do this. This should be what guides us in life — our moral compass, a beacon in the hazy storm that is life. This should be the system of morality that we all adopt. This is preference utilitarianism — namely, preference quasiperfect real sentient total utilitarianism.

**Preference**: Utility is calculated based on the preferences of these beings: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_utilitarianism

**Quasi-perfect**: I'll discuss this later.

**Real**: Fulfillment of preferences is measured based on reality, not the experience of the preferrer. I made this up but it probably exists I just haven't found it.

**Sentient**: All sentient beings count: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentientism

**Total**: The sum of preferences matters, not the average: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_and_total_utilitarianism

**Utilitarianism**: A consequentialist moral theory that seeks to maximize utility, for some definition of it.

I deem this PQRSTU, pronounced "pick we're stew", or "We're Stew" for short. It's true — we are what we eat, and we eat stew! And often, the stew is morally bankrupt: stew with unethically farmed fish, for example. But with PQRSTU, we can choose to eat ethical stew, and become ethical in the process!

As for Quasiperfect, this isn't a perfect moral theory. For example, would you kill all of humanity for a trillion orgasming rats to orgasm forever? You wouldn't. But those rats want to orgasm forever.

But it's a moral theory that works in most cases. And we should use it for most cases. In special cases, like the orgasming rats, or [AI alignment](https://aisafety.info), we can and should think beyond the theory.

So, to all sentient beings: Let us all come together and use PQRSTU in all our conscious actions, to guide the results of our desires.

And to humanity: So long, and thanks for all the fish farming.
