This repository has miscellaneous files and projects that are too small to warrant their own repository. Here's a table of contents:

# Table of Contents
## ASCII Table [ASCIITable.txt]
This is an ASCII table in ASCII, with fancy formatting / ASCII art. It is taken from multiple sources.
## [berlin.py]
This python program creates a GeoJSON for https://www.scribblemaps.com/ connecting a selection of Berlins around the world, using the actual shortest straight-line path rather than a straight line path on the Mercator projection. It is adaptable to other selections of points on a globe as well.
